Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple

creature.&nbsp; Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spiders are one of the smallest, yet most feared, denizens of our planet.&nbsp; Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body.&nbsp; Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.&nbsp; While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.&nbsp; Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.&nbsp; Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.&nbsp; While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.&nbsp; Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color:

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;

nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Sildar.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sildar Hallwinter","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Sildar.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"9Fc4bTPX7c7J2iaY","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.&nbsp; While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.&nbsp; In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.&nbsp; Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.&nbsp; The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.&nbsp; While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.&nbsp; Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master’s orders.&nbsp; This fact of the zombie’s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.&nbsp; Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.&nbsp; It’s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.&nbsp; Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.&nbsp; Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.&nbsp; The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!&nbsp; Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time;

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Tabitha.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tabitha","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/HumanBrownM.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ABggfXn3PuGSPVQK","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"skills","_sheetTab-primary":"features","exportSource":{"world":"1234","system":"dnd5e","coreVersion":"0.6.0","systemVersion":0.92},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"imports/portraits/Monsters/Humanoid/dragon_cultist.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"img":"imports/tokens/Monster/Humanoids/Cultist.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"EJlhWWw3KHhJa5Hi","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/TiborWester2.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tibor Wester","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/TiborWester2.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"EUG4abaON31k3SWg","actorLink":false,"disposition":1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

I still have the damnable sting blisters from their catapults. WASPS! WHAT CREATURE PUTS WASPS IN BAGS AND THROWS THEM AT YOU?! Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br>- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text;

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/sistergaraele-2.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sister Garaele","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/sistergaraele-2.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Jwo32gVAqexeJDTD","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

are the largest of the wild dog species roaming the plains and forests of our wonderful world.&nbsp; Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.&nbsp; Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.&nbsp; This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.&nbsp; WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.&nbsp; When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.&nbsp; It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.&nbsp; Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.&nbsp; The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size:

Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/toblen-stonehill.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tolben Stonehill","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/toblen-stonehill.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"QfXOZYlZHNKILMH8","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to. These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves. Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door. Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures. Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"skills","_sheetTab-primary":"features","exportSource":{"world":"1234","system":"dnd5e","coreVersion":"0.6.0","systemVersion":0.92},"tidy5e-sheet":{"allow-delete":true},"magicitems":{},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"imports/portraits/Monsters/Humanoid/Favric.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"img":"imports/tokens/Monster/Humanoids/Cultist%20Green%20%5BCR1%E2%81%848%2CMedium%2CHumanoid%5D.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"RodVz2CH2jwe21Qq","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/HumanBrownM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Commoner","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/HumanBrownM.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Rq1AIFmOx6Xvq6Am","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Atop the goat&rsquo;s head rests a set of hard horns which, depending upon the species, can vary from short and knobby to long curled protrusions. The goats use their horns for both defense and contests of strength between fellow males (or billies) during spectacular ramming matches. The clattering of mountain goats&rsquo; horns can be heard clearly throughout the valley towns during the creature&rsquo;s mating seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Evil and Garbage.</strong> Goats can be called nothing if not resourceful when it comes to what they choose to ingest. Goats will typically feed upon grass and weeds found in their favored open fields; however, several shepherds have noted their goats eating such objects as iron nails, bits of discarded clothing, and even the wheels of a wagon! The image of a goat has also been co opted by some of the more nefarious of our realm as a symbol of evil to represent various foul cults. Perhaps it is the goat&rsquo;s sinister horizontal pupil that elicits fear in onlookers or their common use by some cultures as a ritualistic sacrifice that drives the cults to utilize their visage. No matter the cause, goats continue to be an integral though stubborn part of our everyday lives as their meat, milk, and utility in flocks makes them a hardy domesticated creature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Mountain","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 330","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"abilities","_sheetTab-primary":"features","dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"monsterblock":{"initialized":true,"attack-descriptions":true,"casting-feature":true,"inline-secrets":false,"hidden-secrets":false,"current-hit-points":true,"maximum-hit-points":true,"hide-profile-image":false,"show-lair-actions":false,"theme-choice":"default","custom-theme-class":""},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/Monsters/Beast/goat.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Goat","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Goat.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"TqQEwHb6scoB6liw","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"fmILoB0arLdodNGB","name":"Charge","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the goat moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.

Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.&nbsp; Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.&nbsp; This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.&nbsp; WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.&nbsp; When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.&nbsp; It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.&nbsp; Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.&nbsp; The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #111111;\"><em style=\"box-sizing:

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/QellineAlderleaf.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Qelline Alderleaf","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/QellineAlderleaf.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"YnLwmj8UNKAzDdjr","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p>\n<p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>PLAYER CHARACTERS AS LYCANTHROPES</strong></p>\n<p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.</p>\n<p>A non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.</p>\n<p>The following information applies to specific lycanthropes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Wererat.</strong></em> The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":"humanoid","environment":"forest, urban","cr":2,"spellLevel":2,"xp":{"value":450,"xp":{"value":450}},"source":"Basic Rules, pg. 327"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":"Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from Nonmagical Attacks that aren't Silvered"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Common (can't speak in rat form)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":3,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"vtta":{"dndbeyond":{"url":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/wererat","spells":[],"img":"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/78/1000/1000/636252735121410517.jpeg"}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/Monsters/Humanoid/ZeleenVarnaster.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zeleen Varnaster","displayName":20,"img":"imports/tokens/Monster/Humanoids/Wererat05_DD.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"Yyvinq9n37gssL7j","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"juWJJFEKJS7LWstZ","name":"Shapechanger","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"The wererat can use its action to polymorph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.&nbsp; Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.&nbsp; Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant’s tasks with exceeding care.&nbsp; Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.&nbsp; The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.&nbsp; The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.&nbsp; Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.&nbsp; The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.&nbsp; With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.&nbsp; The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.&nbsp; Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.&nbsp; One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.&nbsp; Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.&nbsp; Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.&nbsp; Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select:

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Thistle.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Thistle","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Thistle.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"dsJyDyPAI4MBphqt","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to. These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves. Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door. Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures. Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

Those that pass the test rise higher in the Spider Queen’s favor.

Only drow can be turned into driders, and the power to create these creatures resides with Lolth alone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I failed the Spider Queen once.

Driven by madness, they disappear into the Underdark to become hermits and hunters, either wandering alone or leading packs of giant spiders.</p>\n<p>On rare occasion, a drider returns to the fringes of drow society despite its curse, most often to fulfill some longstanding vow or vendetta from its former life. Drow fear and shun the driders, holding them in lower esteem than slaves.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Migal.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Commoner","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/HumanBrownM.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"l6FMjCuHdzRuq3bs","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Greedy Collectors</strong>. An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Stupidity</strong>. Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words — and then being eaten in turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Primitive Wanderers</strong>. Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ogre Gangs</strong>. Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.</p>","public":"<p>Ogres are hulking giants notorious for their quick tempers.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

A&nbsp;modron&nbsp;carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a&nbsp;modron, there is no “I,” but only “we” or “us.”</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Absolute Hierarchy.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Modrons communicate only with their own rank and the ranks immediately above and below them. Modrons more than one rank away are either too advanced or too simple to understand.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cogs of the Great Machine.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;If a&nbsp;modron&nbsp;is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted&nbsp;modron&nbsp;is replaced by one of its underlings&nbsp;in&nbsp;the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new&nbsp;modron&nbsp;is created by Primus, with a steady stream of&nbsp;monodrones&nbsp;leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>VARIANT: ROGUE MODRONS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons don’t act in accordance with Primus’s wishes and directives, breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">A rogue modron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it has the same statistics as a regular modron of its rank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Great Modron March.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;When the gears of Mechanus complete seventeen cycles once every 289 years, Primus sends a vast army of&nbsp;modrons&nbsp;across the Outer Planes, ostensibly on a reconnaissance mission. The march is long and dangerous, and only a small number of&nbsp;modrons&nbsp;returns to Mechanus.</p>"},"alignment":"lawful

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Nilsa_Dendrar.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Nilsa Dendrar","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Nilsa_Dendrar.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"oqW9DjwSz4fJTu6a","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/DaranEdermath.jpeg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Daran Edermath","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/DaranEdermath.jpeg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"sONbOZJ2TT5MM6rR","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Any, usually Common"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}},"dnd5e":{"conditions":[]},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Harbin_Wester.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Harbin Wester","displayName":30,"img":"imports/portraits/NPCs/Harbin_Wester.jpg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":true,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"tSwc6zbWm6dlGkqj","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A stout knob of wood forms a simple, but effective, cudgel.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls.
